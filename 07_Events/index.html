<!--
    Event propagation refers to the process of how events are handled and transmitted through the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy in a web page. There are two phases of event propagation: capturing phase and bubbling phase.

Capturing Phase:

During the capturing phase, the event starts from the root of the DOM hierarchy and trickles down to the target element that triggered the event.
Event handlers attached to elements during this phase are executed in the order of the hierarchy from the root to the target element.
Target Phase:

The event reaches the target element that originally triggered the event.


Bubbling Phase:

After the event reaches the target element, it starts to bubble up from the target element back to the root of the DOM hierarchy.
Event handlers attached to elements during this phase are executed in the reverse order of the hierarchy, from the target element back up to the root.
